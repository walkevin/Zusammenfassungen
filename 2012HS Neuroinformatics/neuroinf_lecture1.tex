\subsection{Neural cell (Neuron)}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{9cm}p{5cm}}
Main components	& A typical neural cell consists of dendrites, the soma (aka pericaryon) and one axon. The axon can have many branches however.	& There are about 10'000 neurons per mm$^3$\\
Soma		& The soma contains various organelles, such as endoplasmatic reticula or mitchondria. Among other substances, it produces Neurotransmitters.	& The soma is about 5 to 100 $\mu$m in diameter.\\
Dendrites	& Dendrites collect the information from other neurons. The dendritic tree of a single neuron can be connected with up to 200'000 other neurons.	& In one mm$^3$, there are about 5m dendrites.\\
Axon		& The axon is more or less branched and each branch ends in presynaptic terminals. 	& Length: 1 $\mu$m - 1 m. Diameter: 0.5 - 10 $\mu$m. In one mm$^3$, there are about 5km axons.\\
Synapses	& The synapse is an interface, through which chemical information can be transmitted from one cell (axon) to the other (dendrite). 	& A neuron has about 10'000 synapses with other neurons. The human brain has about $10^{15}$ synapses.

\subsection{Nervous system}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{15cm}}
Definition	& The nervous system coordinates the activity of all body parts and transmits information from and to them. In most animals, the nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The presence of \textbf{neurons and glial cells} is characteristic for the nervous system. The brain consists of about $10^{11} - 10^{12}$ neurons.\\
CNS		& The CNS is the part of the nervous system that receives information and coordinates activity of all parts of the body. It consists of the \textbf{brain and spinal cord (Rückenmark)}. Sometimes, the retina and the cranial nerves (Hirnnerven) are added to the CNS. Brain and spinal cord are protected by the skull and the backbone respectively.\\
PNS		& The PNS consists of the nerves outside the CNS. Its main function is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs. The PNS is not protected by bones. As an example, the PNS includes motor nerves.
