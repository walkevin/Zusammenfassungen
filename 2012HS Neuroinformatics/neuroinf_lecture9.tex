\section{Lecture 9, Synaptic activation}
\subsection{Dispute over transmission type}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{15cm}}
Chemical transmission	& Otto Loewi 1921: Experiment on vagus nerve / frog heart proves that a chemical substance is responsible for transmission of nerve impulse. Henry Dale later identified this substance as Acetylcholine. The neurotransmitter acted inhibitory, i.e. the heart rate slowed down if the impulse was transmitted.\\
Electrical transmission	& J. Eccles argues the transmission must be of electrical nature, because the chemical transmission (diffusion) would take too long. He later falsified his own theory\\
\end{tabular}\\
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{15cm}}
Neurotransmission	& \begin{enumerate}
                 	  	\item Action potential is triggered and comes down the axon (presynaptic cell)
				\item Vesicles which are already docked at the synapse might release its neurotransmitters into the synapse.\newline
				      The number of neurotransmitters per vesicle is roughly about 1000
                 	  \end{enumerate}\\
Depolarization potential	& 0.1 - 0.3 mV per synapse $\Rightarrow$ If (Action potential threshold) - (Resting potential) = 40mV, then about 133 - 400 synapses need to fire\\
\end{tabular}\\
\subsection{Activation of muscular cells}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{15cm}}
Activation	& Recall: A \textbf{single} synapse activates the action potential of a muscle, unlike central synapses, where only many synapses together can trigger an action potential.\\
Reasons		& \begin{itemize}
       		  	\item Giant synapse with many vesicle releasers and receptors. 
			\item In a neuromuscular synapse, many vesicles can be released simultaneously (Central synapses often release only one vesicle). A vesicle has a specific number of neurotransmitters which it releases.
       		  \end{itemize}\\
Muscle control	& \begin{itemize}
			\item Finesse of muscular control depends on number of motor neurons.
			\item The more motor neurons, the more muscle fibers there are.
              	  \end{itemize}\\
\end{tabular}\\
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{15cm}}
Influencing plasticity	& \begin{itemize}
          	  	\item Probability of firing (has to do with Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations), presynaptic
			\item Number of synapses, presynaptic
			\item Number of receptors, postsynaptic
          	  \end{itemize}
